# Project Principles

# Code Philosophy
- Keep code simple, smart, and follow best practices
- Don't over-engineer for the sake of engineering
- Use standard conventions and patterns
- Write human-readable code
- Keep it simple so the app just works
- Follow the principle: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- Comments should explain "why" behind the code in more complex functions
- Overcommented code is better than undercommented code

# Commit Conventions
- Use Conventional Commits format:
  - feat: new features
  - fix: bug fixes
  - docs: documentation changes
  - style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
  - refactor: code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - test: adding or modifying tests
  - chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.
- Each commit should be atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

# Project Structure

# Root Directory
- Keep root directory clean with only essential files
- Production configuration files in root:
  - docker-compose.yml
  - Dockerfile
  - .env.example
  - package.json
  - README.md

# Source Code (/src)
- All application source code in /src directory
  - app.js: Application setup and configuration
  - server.js: Server entry point
  - routes/: Route handlers
  - middleware/: Custom middleware
  - utils/: Helper functions and utilities
  - models/: Data models (if applicable)
  - services/: Business logic

# Development
- All development configurations in /dev directory
- Development specific files:
  - /dev/docker-compose.dev.yml
  - /dev/.env.dev.example
  - /dev/README.md (development setup instructions)

# Static Assets and Uploads
- Static assets in /public directory
- Upload directories:
  - /uploads (production)
  - /local_uploads (local development)

# Testing
- Tests are mandatory for all new features
- Test files location:
  - Unit tests: __tests__/unit/
  - Integration tests: __tests__/integration/
  - E2E tests: __tests__/e2e/
- Test naming convention:
  - Unit tests: [feature].test.js
  - Integration tests: [feature].integration.test.js
  - E2E tests: [feature].e2e.test.js
- Test coverage requirements:
  - Minimum 80% coverage for new features
  - Must include happy path and error cases
  - API endpoints must have integration tests

# Documentation
- Main README.md in root focuses on production deployment
- Development documentation in /dev/README.md
- Code must be self-documenting with clear naming
- Complex logic must include comments explaining "why" not "what"
- JSDoc comments for public functions and APIs

# Code Style
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use modern JavaScript features appropriately
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
