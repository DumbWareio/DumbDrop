# DumbDrop

A stupid simple file upload application that provides a clean, modern interface for dragging and dropping files. Built with Node.js and vanilla JavaScript.

![DumbDrop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b909d26-9ead-4dc7-85bc-8bfda0d366c1)

No auth (unless you want it!), no complicated setup (unless you want to!), no nothing. Just a simple way to drop dumb files into a dumb folder... or an S3 bucket!

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (For Dummies - Local Storage)
```bash
# Pull and run with one command (uses local storage)
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./uploads:/app/uploads dumbwareio/dumbdrop:latest
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a File - It'll show up in `./uploads` on your host machine.
3. Celebrate on how dumb easy this was.

### Option 2: Docker Compose (For Dummies who like customizing - Local or S3)
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  dumbdrop:
    image: dumbwareio/dumbdrop:latest # Use the desired tag/version
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # Map host port 3000 to container port 3000
    volumes:
      # Mount a host directory to store metadata (.metadata folder)
      # This is needed even for S3 mode to track ongoing uploads.
      # For local storage mode, this is also where files land.
      - ./uploads:/app/uploads
    environment:
      # --- Core Settings ---
      # STORAGE_TYPE: "local" # Options: "local", "s3" (Defaults to "local" if unset)
      DUMBDROP_TITLE: "My DumbDrop"
      BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3000/" # Must end with a slash!
      MAX_FILE_SIZE: 1024 # Max file size in MB
      DUMBDROP_PIN: "" # Optional PIN (4-10 digits)
      AUTO_UPLOAD: "false" # Set to "true" to upload immediately

      # --- Local Storage Settings (if STORAGE_TYPE="local") ---
      UPLOAD_DIR: "/app/uploads" # *Must* be set inside container if using local storage

      # --- S3 Storage Settings (if STORAGE_TYPE="s3") ---
      # S3_REGION: "us-east-1" # Your S3 region (e.g., us-west-000 for B2)
      # S3_BUCKET_NAME: "your-s3-bucket-name" # Your bucket name
      # S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY" # Your S3 Access Key
      # S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" # Your S3 Secret Key
      # S3_ENDPOINT_URL: "" # Optional: e.g., https://s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com for B2, http://minio.local:9000 for Minio
      # S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: "false" # Optional: Set to "true" for providers like Minio

      # --- Optional Settings ---
      # ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS: ".jpg,.png,.pdf" # Comma-separated allowed extensions
      # ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS: "https://organizr.example.com" # Allow embedding in specific origins
      # APPRISE_URL: "" # For notifications
      # FOOTER_LINKS: "My Site @ https://example.com" # Custom footer links
      # CLIENT_MAX_RETRIES: 5 # Client-side chunk retry attempts
    restart: unless-stopped
```
Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a File - It'll show up in `./uploads` (if local) or your S3 bucket (if S3).
3. Rejoice in the glory of your dumb uploads, now potentially in the cloud!

> **Note:** When using `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`, the local volume mount (`./uploads:/app/uploads`) is still used to store temporary metadata files (`.metadata` folder) for tracking multipart uploads. The actual files go to S3.

-   **Storage:** Set `STORAGE_TYPE` to `s3` to enable S3 storage. Otherwise, it defaults to `local`.
-   **Local Storage:** If `STORAGE_TYPE=local`, `UPLOAD_DIR` (in Docker) or `LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR` (local dev) determines where files are stored.
-   **S3 Storage:** If `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`, the `S3_*` variables are required. `UPLOAD_DIR`/`LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR` is still used for storing temporary `.metadata` files locally.
-   **S3 Endpoint/Path Style:** Use `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` and `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` only if connecting to a non-AWS S3-compatible service.
-   **BASE_URL**: Must end with a trailing slash (`/`). The app will fail to start otherwise. Example: `http://your.domain.com/dumbdrop/`.
-   **Security Note (S3):** For production, using IAM Roles (e.g., EC2 Instance Profiles, ECS Task Roles) is strongly recommended over embedding Access Keys in environment variables.

See `.env.example` for a template.

<details>
<summary>ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS</summary>

To allow this app to be embedded in an iframe on specific origins (such as Organizr), set the `ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS` environment variable. For example:

```env
ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS=https://organizr.example.com,https://myportal.com
```

- If not set, the app will only allow itself to be embedded in an iframe on the same origin (default security).
- If set, the app will allow embedding in iframes on the specified origins and itself.
- **Security Note:** Only add trusted origins. Allowing arbitrary origins can expose your app to clickjacking and other attacks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>File Extension Filtering</summary>

To restrict which file types can be uploaded, set the `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` environment variable with comma-separated extensions (including the dot):
```env
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt
```
If not set, all file extensions will be allowed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Notification Setup</summary>

#### Message Templates
The notification message supports the following placeholders:
- `{filename}`: Name of the uploaded file (or S3 Key)
- `{size}`: Size of the file (formatted according to APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT)
- `{storage}`: Total size of all files in upload directory (Local storage only)

Example message template:
```env
APPRISE_MESSAGE: New file dropped: {filename} ({size})!
```

Size formatting examples:
- Auto (default): Chooses nearest unit (e.g., "1.44MB", "256KB")
- Fixed unit: Set APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT to B, KB, MB, GB, or TB

#### Notification Support
- Integration with [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-notifications) for flexible notifications
- Customizable notification messages
- Optional - disabled if no APPRISE_URL is set
</details>

<details>
<summary>S3 Cleanup Recommendation</summary>

When using `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`, DumbDrop relies on the native S3 Multipart Upload mechanism. If an upload is interrupted, incomplete parts may remain in your S3 bucket.

**It is strongly recommended to configure a Lifecycle Rule on your S3 bucket** (or use your provider's equivalent tool) to automatically abort and delete incomplete multipart uploads after a reasonable period (e.g., 1-7 days). This prevents orphaned parts from accumulating costs. DumbDrop's cleanup only removes local tracking files, not the actual S3 parts.
</details>

## Security

### Features
- Variable-length PIN support (4-10 digits)
- Constant-time PIN comparison
- Input sanitization (filenames, paths)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- File extension filtering
- No client-side PIN storage
- Secure file handling (uses S3 presigned URLs for downloads if S3 is enabled)

## Technical Details

### Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js (>=20.0.0) with Express
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Local Filesystem or S3-compatible Object Storage
- **Container**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Security**: Express security middleware
- **Upload**: Chunked uploads via client-side logic, processed via Express middleware, using native S3 Multipart Upload when `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`.
- **Notifications**: Apprise integration
- **SDK**: AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`) when `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`.

### Dependencies
- `express`: Web framework
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3`: AWS S3 SDK (used if `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`)
- `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`: For S3 presigned URLs (used if `STORAGE_TYPE=s3`)
- `cookie-parser`: Parse cookies
- `cors`: Cross-origin resource sharing
- `dotenv`: Environment configuration
- `express-rate-limit`: Rate limiting
